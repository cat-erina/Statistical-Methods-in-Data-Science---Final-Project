# Statistical-Methods-in-Data-Science---Final-Project
## _July 2020_

Goal: perform an in-depth fully Bayesian analysis (using MCMC simulation) of some real data

Tools: R, JAGS

Steps:
1. illustration of the dataset
2. explaination the overall features of the statistical model such as the role of the parameters and the inferential goals of the analysis
3. illustration of the main inferential findings (Bayesian point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing)
4. discusssion one possible alternative statistical model and illustratation results of model comparison through DIC and/or marginal likelihood 
5. illustration of the features of the MCMC output, error control, convergence diagnostics
